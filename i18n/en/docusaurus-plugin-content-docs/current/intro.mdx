Create a **new scene** and place `ExportAvatar` in the scene.

Operating in the Avatar scene may cause issues, so uploading in a separate scene is recommended.

You can create a new scene by going to `File` > `New Scene`.

Place the avatar in the scene and upload using your usual procedure.

:::tip

When you export an avatar, a `save.json` file is created in the export destination folder, which allows you to restore previous editing content using `Load SaveData` the next time you run the creator function.

## Want to Make Your Avatar Public?

This avatar can be made Public on VRChat under the following conditions:

- Add the included shop information gimmick
- Contact the creator (@kurotori4423) with the Blueprint ID of the avatar you want to make Public.

The shop information gimmick is a prefab called `OpenShopInfo` located under the `Lugharian` folder, which should be added to the avatar you want to upload.
